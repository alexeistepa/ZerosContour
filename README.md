# ZerosContour

A Python implementation of an algorithm for finding all zeros of a homomorphic function in a given region, from the paper:

Michael Dellnitz, Oliver Sch√ºtze, and Qinghua Zheng. "Locating all the zeros of an analytic function in one complex variable." *Journal of Computational and Applied mathematics* 138.2:325-333 (2002).

- The notebook `Test.ipynb` tests the code on examples of functions with known zeros.
- The notebook `SchrodEigs.ipynb` applies the code to find zeros of certain non-self-adjoint Schr&ouml;dinger operators.

This code was used in my paper 

Alexei Stepanenko. "Spectral inclusion and pollution for a class of dissipative perturbations". *Journal of Mathematical Physics* 62(1):013501 (2021)

to create the following figure:

Idea of algorithm
-----------------
Given a region $\Omega = (\Re(b),\Re(b)+w)\times i (\Im(b),\Im(b)+h)$ (here $b \in \mathbb C, w,h \in \mathbb R$) in the complex plane we can calculate the number of zeros $N$ in $\Omega$ of a holomorphic function $f$ by the argument principle,
$$N =  \frac{1}{2 \pi i}\int_{\Omega} \frac{f'}{f}.$$
We split $\Omega$ into four quarters and apply the argument principle to determine wether each quarter contains at least one zero. This gives us an enclosure for the containing the zeros of $f$ in $\Omega$. 
To refine this enclosure, we take each quarter that contains at least one zero and again apply the same procedure to it, splittling it into 4 quarters and applying the argument principle. We iterate this process to obtain an enclosure consisting of a union of small boxes. We stop the iterations if either each box in the encosure only contains one zero and a minimum nimber of iterations has been reached, or if some threshold value for the number of iterations has been reached. In our implementation, we use the computer algebra package `SymPy` to evaluate $f'/f$, given $f$.
